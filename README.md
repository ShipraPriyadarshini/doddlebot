This network is a project for Deep Learning in the 2022 Spring semester at Brown

It is a novel implementation of the model described in this paper by Forest Huang and John F. Canny: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04399.pdf

The model is implemented mostly in the ```DLFinalProject.ipynb``` notebook, but some code is in this repo (which is pulled in the notebook): 

https://github.com/salbrandi/Decoder-SketchRNN, 

which is a fork of this repo:
